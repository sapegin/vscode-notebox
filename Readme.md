_The notes are persisted even if you close VS Code or switch to another workspace._

## Changelog

The changelog can be found on the [Changelog.md](./Changelog.md) file.

## Motivation

There are several extensions for writing notes inside VS Code, but all are either too complex, or not working at all. I wanted something simple, a place to write a short reminder for myself, or store a piece of text or code that will be useful later.
